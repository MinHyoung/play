/**
 * URL (Uniform Resource Locator) Encoding and Decoding
 *
 * Reference:
 * - http://blog.lunatech.com/2009/02/03/what-every-web-developer-must-know-about-url-encoding
 * - http://illegalargumentexception.blogspot.com/2009/12/java-safe-character-handling-and-url.html
 * - http://wiki.apache.org/HttpComponents/FrequentlyAskedApplicationDesignQuestions
 *
 * Terminology:
 *  - URI
 *  - URL
 *  - URN
 * Components of a URL:
 *  Scheme
 *  User
 *  Password
 *  Host Address (Domain Name)
 *  Port
 *  Path (Path Segment)
 *  Path Parameters
 *  Query Parameters
 *  Fragment
 *
 *  Scheme and Host part are separated by "://"
 *  Host and path fragments are separated by "/"
 *  Path parameters are located at the end of the path segment after a ";", and
 *  separated from other path parameters by a ";" character
 *  Query parameters are located at the end of path part after a "?", and separated
 *  from other parameters by a "&" character
 *
 * Common Encodings
 *  "?"  - %3F
 *  " "  - %20 or "+"
 *  "+"  - %2B
 *  "/"  - %2F
 *  "&"  - %26
 *
 *  The following reserved characters in the query string (the part after question mark) must be
 *  URL escaped. URL-escaping for the query part can be handed by java.net.URI and
 *  org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI
 *   "="
 *   "&"
 *   "%"
 *   ":"
 *   "/"
 *   "+"
 *
 *
 * Takeaways:
 *  - Reserved characters are different for each part.
 *  - Don't analyze a URL after decoding
 *  - Decoded URLs cannot be re-encoded to the same form
 *  - Don't use java.net.URLEncoder or java.net.URLDecoder for whole URLs. They only escape/un-escape
 *    'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' (form-data) data, but won't parse parameters
 *  - Don't construct URLs without encoding each part
 *  - Don't expect URI.getPath() to give you structured data; Use URI.getRawPath() instead
 *
 *  Dependencies:
 *  jsr311-api.jar
